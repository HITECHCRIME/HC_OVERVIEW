## /// INJECTIONS [ALBUMS] | Current count: 44 EPs

Motifs: dead of blight, oracle, triangles, moth's flight, the life's search, hacking reality, hacker persona, meditation, attunement with the environment, isolation, separation.

Content Font Regime is `_` as `:` or `-`. Use `///` to designate line in code/text/content/header. Use hard brackets `[]` for additional info `[Rough Prototype] / [Zodiacal Series]`. 

Brutalist architecture and movement, monumental futura, dirty cyberpunk, self-improvement themes, high technology, minimalism, squad with a goal (hack the world). 

Use `Hitech Crime presents`? That was one of the initial ideas - to make it feel like a narrative. Moodboard audio series style? Moodboard transitions between songs both in audio and visual. Sequential montages but could be played in a different order or random (hard cut). Web series vibe from the 2010s.

> Observation that the very act of becoming a player changes the game being played. It is reflected in interviewing process where the interviewees tend to give answers they think interviewer wants to hear. Named after German Noble-laureate physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901-76) whose uncertainty principle states that (in particle physics experiments) the very act of observing alters the position of the particle being observed, and makes it impossible (even in theory) to accurately predict its behavior. See also observer inseparability.

- **Satsu Song**
Miedo de mi 
Miedo de mi
Miedo de mi
Miedo de mi
Tengo el demonio hablándole a mi oreja
Ya tengo mil 
Tiros contados pa la balacera
El ídolo tuyo es una marioneta
Dale en la nuca 
Subelo a la guagua

Ya me tomé la tableta de xanax
Pintando con tu sangre el pentagrama
Se abre tu pecho y te salen garras
Y así me robó de tu alma
Miedo mi 
Tu cara de horror 
Cuando me vistes empacado en el congelador

(Demon voices)
No quedarán tus huesos después de la cena
Dale un latigazo pa que pague por sus penas
Ya tengo tu medula congelada en la nevera

Fear of me 
Fear of me 
Fear of me 
Fear of me 
I have the devil talking to my ear 
I already have a thousand 
Shots counted for the shooting 
The idol of yours is a puppet 
Hit the neck Upload it to the bus
I already took the xanax tablet 
Painting with your blood the pentagram 
Your chest opens and claws come out
And so it robbed me of your soul 
Fear me
Your horror face 
When you dress me packed in the freezer

(Demon voices) 
There will be no bones left after dinner 
Give him a whip to pay for his sorrows 
I already have your medulla frozen in the fridge

# SONG & ALBUM IDEAS
- idea make a synthetic language to sing/rap in
- EP where each song is basically an episode of a web series (this could slowly turn into a trap musical narrative haha)
- MOTHNODE_ SLC6A3 (Gene codename - dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome - good for productivity esoterism albums)

https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC6A3

> The SLC6A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the dopamine transporter or DAT. This protein is embedded in the membrane of certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it transports a molecule called dopamine into the cell. Dopamine is a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that relays signals from one neuron to another. Dopamine has many important functions, including playing complex roles in thought (cognition), motivation, behavior, and control of movement.

> To transmit signals, dopamine is released into the space between neurons (the synaptic cleft), where it attaches (binds) to receptors on the surface of neighboring neurons. The dopamine transporter brings dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into neurons for reuse. The activity of the transporter determines how much dopamine is present in the synaptic cleft and for how long. This activity makes the transporter a major controller of dopamine signaling in the brain.

# Audiovisual IRL Experiences (Musical Narrative Universe)
Ideas for the visuals and setups for concerts. Could also be applied to live online concerts.
- wall of death with a vertical "laser gate" pulsing and expanding to separate two groups of people. It lifts in the middle before the clash as the drop comes.
- aggro popup concert from a mobile backpack audio unit
- secret location concerts
- "now we will cleanse the perimeter with bass to get rid of the (audible) bad programs" / "audio weapon" - purging tool
- laser-gating
- laser ceiling scissors (lasers shifting horizontally above user's head)
- concerts are literally audiovisual sets - theatrical almost, with placing importance on pacing, pressurizing and depressurizing the audience, tension vs relax vs intrigue.
- Look at the BTSM experiences they create (they include narrative experiences, lasers, smoke and colorful glitchy. Church of BTSM). It is more rave like tho.
- Dropbox contains a lot of visal inspirations. Comb through it!

# BLACKLANE_ Electronic soundscapes.
