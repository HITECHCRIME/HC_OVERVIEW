# HITECH CRIME | AUDIO FUTURA MICROLABEL UNIVERSE

MINIMAL FUTURA AGGRO TRAP / CHANTRAP / FUTURAP - HITECH CRIME MYTHOS

THE WEYLAND-YUTANI OF TRAP MUSIC

```
**Hitech Crime** is a microlabel acting as a unified hub for creative and experimental audio projects. Its *creative aim* is to build an audiovisual universe with unique lore and narratives.

Its *technical aim* is to research, develop and execute ideas in form of new wave interactive performances/experiences and create futuristic audio and related visual communication using creative technology.

As an expressive entity it explores and expresses topics ranging from *psychology*, *transhumanism*, *human edge*, *niche cyberpunk* to *predictive societal changes of the future in relation to the advancement of technology*.

Album/song releases are like plot points in a bigger narrative (overarching themes) accompanied by rich media content. Various timelines are different subthemes: cyberpunk, dark trap, scifi, tribalism, control your future, human enhancement/transhumanism etc.

Seasons are overarching themes. A "whole set" would be all elements of content that belong to the a particular season (story arcs, microthemes, album narrative music videos etc).

What we're creating here is a "storyworld". We are basing it on trap music and culture but want to completely change the approach to this and any type of music/genre as a not only solely audio experience.

“Humans do not engage in activities that are meaningless. If you think you see people doing things you find meaningless, look again, and try to understand what the activities mean for them.”

– Henry Jenkins

Transmedia storytelling has no beginning, middle or end. Let the audience fill in the gaps with their engagement on various platforms of expression. This leads to potential monetization of engagement via "subscribing to a storyworld". Hitech Crime microlabel is a universe that the audience can explore and help it evolve. Think of Westworld business model - I know, ironic since it's ficticious and technology is not there yet. But the idea is similar.

Hitech Crime Universe. Depends on the timeline: dystopia, cyberpunk, near future, alternative real world timelines.

Hitech Crime Storyworld comes from a VOID [all possible futures/timelines], then it goes through ASCENSION [progress of all possible futures/timelines] into RELEASE [enlightenment and the making of choice].

Construct a dopamine loop (memetic dependence based on subconscious value of acknowledging the search for purpose in life, search of identity, search for self and core drives).

HITECH CRIME UNIVERSE < content content content > AUDIENCE (sustained feedback loop via audience interaction)

(both ways interaction, get personal, send things, choose at random, create engagement)

A little bit of David Lynch approach: 

- We live as characters in different Hitech Crime Universe timelines (within HCU, not overview branding-wise, not in terms of narrative brand entities). We can become selfaware. Cross the worlds between fiction and reality.

> Spirit of film (giant)
> Spirit of tv (midget)
> Spirit of internet (?) (the fire itself?) < --- time to face this demon

- commentary on consumable ficticious violence and the meaning of meaning

# Transmedia Storytelling Notes

BENEFITS

- Transmedia encourages and supports consumer participation, from interactions across channels to the co-creation of products, stories, and messages.
- Transmedia allows the brand to go “surround sound.” This means, when a customer is looking for insights about your topic, your information is available on their channel of choice, from social media to podcasts to documents.
- Leverage multimedia content to create a richer brand experience across channels by experimenting with emerging channels such as podcasts, virtual reality, brand-run TV shows, and more.
- Amplify messages and explore the best format for telling them—by experimenting with a full range of different forms and media to flesh out a complete transmedia strategy.

LIMITATIONS

- Coordinating and collaborating with individual sectors of a media conglomerate can be a challenge.
- While entry points may entice a range of consumers, it may also provide many points to push consumers away.
- It could get hard to understand the entire dynamic of a franchise if you have several content creators.
- Balancing content between hardcore fans and casual fans is a daunting task.
- Not all stories are suitable for transmedia storytelling.

> A story that moves in an entirely unconventional direction is an essential component of transmedia storytelling. The three pillars namely, the core story, the worldview, and the main characters aim to establish multi-platforming. Which means, they are designed to be open stories that can be developed into different media. They do not own one another but serve as an entry point to the next installment of the franchise.

Independent Film Perspective

> With no multi-million dollar campaigns, the success of independent films is achieved through a strong word of mouth and good reviews from the press (also, a few awards at the most important festivals). Transmedia approach allows the producers and the film’s creative team to start establishing that word of mouth process early on so it can grow, like a snowball, during the entire production process, so when the movie is released it already has an audience. The success of films like Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch Project, and the more recent Kevin Smith’s Red State was the result of the buzz established by the production using social media and the internet. 

> The unique ability of transmedia storytelling to utilize various forms of media to widen consumer choice and to provide familiar yet new content gives it an outstanding potential as a marketing strategy. And for consumers to properly engage with the created narrative through this strategy, it is necessary to try out multiple media platforms and contribute to the available information and knowledge about the story.

> However, these qualities of transmedia storytelling also have the potential to create a negative effect on the marketability of a product, merely because not all consumers are willing to navigate through various platforms to fully understand the narrative world. As the story adds information and content, it has the risk of morphing into something that only appeals to a small group of cult fans rather than the mass audience. It is vital to offer a story that inspires consumers to actively participate in the larger network of content for you to reach the full market potential of transmedia storytelling.

1. Transmedia storytelling represents a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes it own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story. So, for example, in The Matrix franchise, key bits of information are conveyed through three live action films, a series of animated shorts, two collections of comic book stories, and several video games. There is no one single source or ur-text where one can turn to gain all of the information needed to comprehend the Matrix universe.

2. Transmedia storytelling reflects the economics of media consolidation or what industry observers call "synergy." Modern media companies are horizontally integrated - that is, they hold interests across a range of what were once distinct media industries. A media conglomerate has an incentive to spread its brand or expand its franchises across as many different media platforms as possible. Consider, for example, the comic books published in advance of the release of such films as Batman Begins and Superman Returns by DC ( owned by Warner Brothers, the studio that released these films). These comics provided back-story which enhanced the viewer's experience of the film even as they also help to publicize the forthcoming release (thus blurring the line between marketing and entertainment). The current configuration of the entertainment industry makes transmedia expansion an economic imperative, yet the most gifted transmedia artists also surf these marketplace pressures to create a more expansive and immersive story than would have been possible otherwise.

3. Most often, transmedia stories are based not on individual characters or specific plots but rather complex fictional worlds which can sustain multiple interrelated characters and their stories. This process of world-building encourages an encyclopedic impulse in both readers and writers. We are drawn to master what can be known about a world which always expands beyond our grasp. This is a very different pleasure than we associate with the closure found in most classically constructed narratives, where we expect to leave the theatre knowing everything that is required to make sense of a particular story.

4. Extensions may serve a variety of different functions. For example, the BBC used radio dramas to maintain audience interest in Doctor Who during almost a decade during which no new television episodes were produced. The extension may provide insight into the characters and their motivations (as in the case of websites surrounding Dawson's Creek and Veronica Mars which reproduced the imaginary correspondence or journals of their feature characters), may flesh out aspects of the fictional world (as in the web version of the Daily Planet published each week by DC comics during the run of its 52 series to "report" on the events occurring across its superhero universe), or may bridge between events depicted in a series of sequels (as in the animated series - The Clone Wars - which was aired on the Cartoon Network to bridge over a lapse in time between Star Wars II and III). The extension may add a greater sense of realism to the fiction as a whole (as occurs when fake documents and time lines were produced for the website associated with The Blair Witch Project or in a different sense, the documentary films and cd-roms produced by James Cameron to provide historical context for Titanic).

5. Transmedia storytelling practices may expand the potential market for a property by creating different points of entry for different audience segments. So, for example, Marvel produces comic books which tell the Spider-man story in ways that they think will be particularly attractive to female (a romance comic, Mary Jane Loves Spiderman) or younger readers (coloring book or picture book versions of the classic comicbook stories ). Similarly, the strategy may work to draw viewers who are comfortable in a particular medium to experiment with alternative media platforms (as in the development of a Desperate Housewives game designed to attract older female consumers into gaming).

6. Ideally, each individual episode must be accessible on its own terms even as it makes a unique contribution to the narrative system as a whole. Game designer Neil Young coined the term, "additive comprehension," to refer to the ways that each new texts adds a new piece of information which forces us to revise our understanding of the fiction as a whole. His example was the addition of an image of an origami unicorn to the director's cut edition of Bladerunner, an element which raised questions about whether the protagonist might be a replicant. Transmedia producers have found it difficult to achieve the delicate balance between creating stories which make sense to first time viewers and building in elements which enhance the experience of people reading across multiple media.

7. Because transmedia storytelling requires a high degree of coordination across the different media sectors, it has so far worked best either in independent projects where the same artist shapes the story across all of the media involved or in projects where strong collaboration (or co-creation) is encouraged across the different divisions of the same company. Most media franchises, however, are governed not by co-creation (which involves conceiving the property in transmedia terms from the outset) but rather licensing (where the story originates in one media and subsequent media remain subordinate to the original master text.)

8. Transmedia storytelling is the ideal aesthetic form for an era of collective intelligence. Pierre Levy coined the term, collective intelligence, to refer to new social structures that enable the production and circulation of knowledge within a networked society. Participants pool information and tap each others expertise as they work together to solve problems. Levy argues that art in an age of collective intelligence functions as a cultural attractor, drawing together like-minded individuals to form new knowledge communities. Transmedia narratives also function as textual activators - setting into motion the production, assessment, and archiving information. The ABC television drama, Lost, for example, flashed a dense map in the midst of one second season episode: fans digitized a freeze-frame of the image and put it on the web where together they extrapolated about what it might reveal regarding the Hanso Corporation and its activities on the island. Transmedia storytelling expands what can be known about a particular fictional world while dispersing that information, insuring that no one consumer knows everything and insure that they must talk about the series with others (see, for example, the hundreds of different species featured in Pokemon or Yu-Gi-O). Consumers become hunters and gatherers moving back across the various narratives trying to stitch together a coherent picture from the dispersed information.

9. A transmedia text does not simply disperse information: it provides a set of roles and goals which readers can assume as they enact aspects of the story through their everyday life. We might see this performative dimension at play with the release of action figures which encourage children to construct their own stories about the fictional characters or costumes and role playing games which invite us to immerse ourselves in the world of the fiction. In the case of Star Wars, the Boba Fett action figure generated consumer interest in a character who had otherwise played a small role in the series, creating pressure for giving that character a larger plot function in future stories.

10. The encyclopedic ambitions of transmedia texts often results in what might be seen as gaps or excesses in the unfolding of the story: that is, they introduce potential plots which can not be fully told or extra details which hint at more than can be revealed. Readers, thus, have a strong incentive to continue to elaborate on these story elements, working them over through their speculations, until they take on a life of their own. Fan fiction can be seen as an unauthorized expansion of these media franchises into new directions which reflect the reader's desire to "fill in the gaps" they have discovered in the commercially produced material.

"Our lives are constructed around stories that we tell each other and ourselves, about the complex things that happen to us everyday. We strip away the extraneous details and condense experiences into simplified narratives. So that we can store important information in a way that's easier to remember, when we need to remember it. These stories form our understanding and our memory of the world, and of the people we interact with. When we connect what we learn from each of these episodic narratives in our own memories, important life lessons emerge. Guiding the way we behave and the way we live within our society. As we experience our own life stories, the things that happen to us have an emotional impact. If someone's nice to us, we feel welcome. We laugh when something's funny, we cry when something's sad, and we get angry when we feel something's unjust."

"Emotions serve as a powerful mechanism to help us connect appropriate parts of the different stories together to learn our life lessons. Even though the specific details of each of our own stories are different, all humans share common emotional responses. So, emotions can be used as a hook by storytellers to engage a very diverse audience in a narrative, no matter how different they are in terms of their language, culture, or experience. Emotional response can also be a common touch point that storytellers can use, to help communicate very important messages to others in a condensed format. By connecting complex ideas to emotions, an audience can relate life lessons in a story to their own memories, emotions and in a way that's personally meaningful for them. They can integrate the new message with their own experience and we can learn from it."

Without some kind of personal relevance, any story will hold little interest to a value for any audience.

In this way, every story is about the different challenges, struggles and experiences that we all have to go through. All stories are about the transformation of the status of their characters from their original state to a more enlightened, wiser position through some sort of trial or test.

They stand as a guide as to how to conduct our own journey through life and end up in a better place than where we started.

It all depicts change. Get people accustomed to change, ease the pain of change.

All stories have a purpose, a moral that can be learned through the hero's transformation. Positive life-lesson? Depiction of "life" change before learning the lesson and after.

Plot - sequence of events as they unfold, linear
Story - is the thing we understand after watching the sequence of events
Structure of information we assemble. Chunking of information and expecting people to piece it together.

Story is a result of experiencing the plot.

Story in transmedia: there is a narrative logic to it even if different projects tell different stories in different timelines and versions of reality. They all belong to one storyworld.

Story is what we have in our mind once we consumed a plot of a movie. More information processed together, no one person is going to know all the parts of the story which creates a social opportunity for people to pull knowledge together and keep the story alive.

slave to a king story - comedy
king to a slave - tragedy

It is all about going through ups and downs (exchange of status) and be able to learn from that. Identify with the protagonist. Moral purpose.

So if you know your central character, what they want, what they need, where they're trying to get to, what motivates them than the plot rights itself. If I have a plot about somebody who is very upset about their situation in life, and they want to change things and an opportunity comes along, that writes what happens. Not only does character motivation work, but the world can be given a motivation. The world is trying to set itself right.

So, what we're doing here, when we're talking about a story world, is we're taking our expectations of reality, and we're applying them into the storytelling. And that's very satisfying, that's a very good thing that everything stays the same. So the story world is actually about internal consistency. It's about there being internal rules, and the rules can be whatever you want. They can be that everyone is blue and they can fly, that's fine.

But there needs to be internal rules that you follow. And those rules, once they're in place, can extend in all kinds of different directions, because they tell us what will happen.

Characters have to fight to get it. And win or lose, they're going to find out what they really needed. It might differ from they thought they wanted making it an enlightening experience for both the characters and the audience. And that's pretty much the absolute nutshell of the whole Campbell Jungian thing which can fill several textbooks, so.

Concept: story is an episodic memory, a dream. In trans-media various elements come together into an idea. Conjuring narratives comes natural to a human brain. It works especially well with images and videos.

You don't remember the exact sequence of words in a book. You remember the mental imagery. An emotional contour.

World - integrated system with a lot of moving parts. Characters, settings, myths, artifacts, rules. A  whole system of society or a culture.

Transmedia: After telling a basic story you can picture an oral storyteller stopping at that point and extending outward and telling you more about those characters that the audience is really engaged and interested in. So those are points of extension, points where we could build out.

"So you can sort of say that Tolstoy wanted to become a game designer, he just didnt have the technology. He wanted to have an immersive space that the viewer could travel through and within which he could play out different permutations, and if I tweak this variable then the outcome would have been different and here's how. But everything in, Tolstoy give almost a full on game design manual there. To how we build out war and peace into other media platforms. So I would say writers and storytellers throughout history have wanted to be able to expand the canvas in which they construct their stories and extend the story into other medium.

It's just they often didn't have the resources to do that as fully as they might like. But looking for those moments in the story helps you to figure out where the extensions should go.

Story, memory and meaning

- We remember things that happen to us in our lives by stripping away extraneous details, and condensing experiences into simplified narratives.

- When we connect what we learn from each of these episodic narratives in our own memories, important life lessons emerge – guiding the way we behave and live within our broader society.

- Our own life experiences have an emotional impact upon us. No matter who we are, we all have common emotional responses to different situations.

- Eliciting emotional responses in a story can therefore be used as a way to engage with diverse audiences in a similar manner, and communicate an important life lesson, or moral.

The Hero’s Journey

- In his 1949 book about comparative mythology, “The Hero with a Thousand Faces”, Joseph Campbell noted that most stories share the same structure. He called this structure the monomyth.
Christopher Vogler distilled this monomyth into a series of simple steps called ‘Stages of the hero’s journey’. These simple steps form the basic structure for the majority of all stories told today. Refer to the Key Concept - The anatomy of story lecture earlier in the module for more detail.

- The hero’s journey depicts change – a life lesson that must be learned the hard way by undertaking a personal journey to reach a new understanding. By connecting to the emotive elements in such stories, the audience can undertake the journey with the hero, so that they too can learn from the moral of the story and relate it to their own experience.

**Character archetypes**

- In his book “The Writer’s Journey: Mythic Structure for Storytellers and Screenwriters”, Christopher Vogler described the eight most common character archetypes appearing in most stories. An archetype is something that exhibits typical elements of certain personalities.

- Most stories contain several of these archetypes, that interact in specific stages of the hero's journey, but not all stories need to contain them all.

- Using character archetypes in combination with the stages of the hero's journey can help you structure your own stories.

- Expose character dynamics, keep the dialogue interesting.

**The moral**

- One of the most important elements of a story is its moral. All stories have an instructional purpose, and the moral is a lesson that can be learned through the transformative journey of the hero.

- The moral can usually be distilled into one simple core message that is designed to help provide a positive life lesson to the audience, and provide the context that defines the detail in all other elements within the story.

- Characters motivations are usually driven by the moral - highlighting the positive effects from heeding the moral, and the negative effects of ignoring it.

- The moral is usually revealed at the end of the hero’s journey, as the hero changes status as a result from learning the central life lesson being told.

- The journey, characters, motivations and moral of the story also have a bearing upon how you choose to use engage different audiences, and therefore which technologies you use.

- True connection and engagement with an audience comes from our ability to personally relate to the moral of the story, through emotional connections between the characters and their experiences, and our own personal stories that guide our lives.

Remember that the structure of your story is critical. To engage your audience, you need to take them on an emotional journey, with some kind of transformation for the hero because of a life lesson being learned. The audience needs to relate this transformation to their own experience.

"The structure discussed above can also apply to marketing strategies, or campaigns for social change. Simply replace the hero in your story with members of the audience. What journey do you want them to go on, or what understanding do you want them to develop by engaging in your transmedia strategy?"

Narratives are overarching - world arcs, character arcs (!), motif arcs.

"So to your point about that multi discipline of narrative, we need to come up with the right language for the individual and that language is not just spoken language but it's also, is it an interface? Is it using a book? Is it using Kindle? Is it using virtual reality, augmented reality. >> We can tell one type of story that exists as a narrative from A to Z. It tells a story of a character, or a story of a brand, or a story of a musician, or album."

"And it gives you that all the way through. And takes you on a sort of traditional journey, right? And we can use multiple types of media or types of assets to do that. So for music for example the album package will tell you one thing. And that will lead into a single cover and the single covers will expand on an album package. That will lead into the videos. The videos will open that up and really let you dive in. The tour and the event cycle, really then take it to a whole other level right then take it to a whole other level right there. And that ends up being less traditional of a story and more conceptual narrative. We're talking about ideas, we're talking about evoking emotions, whatever the artist is trying to say in that place. For brands, a lot of the time the story is what is this brand story? What are they trying to accomplish? How do we bring people along for the ride? So that, at the end of it, they understand the brand.

They understand the concepts behind or the mission statement behind the brand or what they're trying to achieve. And then, other types of scenario, for us, is really like interweaving all kinds of various storylines or ideas that don't necessarily feel like they go together, on first glance. But then when you take that 30,000 foot view and you step back from it and you see it all play out and you realize all the way along the road there they were connecting that and leading me down a path, that I wasn't aware of."

> Transmedia journalism is designing a project to unfold across multiple media in an expansive rather than repetitive way. In the movie and music industries much of a transmedia story may be told in a film or on an album. But a series of interconnected stories or pieces of context may be told through games, comics, novels, Web media, fan fiction and even amusement parks. Those other pieces expand rather than repeat the story.

> A Story World: A transmedia project explores a space that contains multiple characters who can each tell multiple stories. It’s a space that you can draw a border around, like Batman’s Gotham City or that galaxy far far away. In journalism this could be a physical space like a neighborhood, a social space like a community, or an issue space like immigration or climate change. It could also be an ongoing beat topic, like state government.

> Media Forms: The interconnected stories from that world take advantage of the different forms media can take. These include text, audio, video, game and interactive forms, graphic nonfiction, physical artifacts, lectures and many others. These ‘languages’ tell stories in unique ways. Stories from our world should use the media form that best fits the way an individual story in our world should be told. Nearly any media form can tell a good journalistic story if we use our usual forethought and ethical rigor.

> Media Channels: Those forms can all be distributed in multiple ways. Text, for example, can be published by newspapers, magazines, the Web, or even sidewalk chalk and sky writing. These are media channels, or connection points with an audience. As we take advantage of the media forms above, we want to take advantage of the many ways we can reach varying audiences. For example, regular newspaper readers differ from gamers in where and how they can be found. Here we decide who it is important to reach, and place media to find those audiences. Journalism options include various print media, television, radio, museums, lectures, game consoles, public projections, billboards or any other means for the stories to be seen. Nearly any media channel could be used to tell a journalistic story. Websites and mobile apps are powerful channels as they can display many of the forms listed above. But they are each only single media channels with particular audiences. They alone don’t answer all our needs.

> Partnerships: Few organizations exist that have the skills to produce many media forms and have access to many media channels. This requires teamwork between skilled producers of different media forms as well as cooperation between the owners of various media channels. Each partner would gain from the work or distribution of the others.

> What it Creates: By telling interconnected stories we can embrace the nuance and complexity that exists in any story world. Through multiple forms we can engage the different parts of our story-loving brains. By distributing them across varying channels we can target the audiences that really matter.

Media Form (Story Language)

> “Pictures can’t say ain’t.” Sol Worth

> I’ll come back to content in later posts. First the idea of media form merits some examples for which I didn’t have room in the linked article. Media form, one of the two terms I use to replace the vague and often-conflated singular medium, has been variously described as a language of storytelling, as semiotics, or as modes. The best way to understand what separates it from its partner media channel is that a media form can be published in many different places. The media channel is the place. For example, text is a media form. It’s common and old (from the dawn of writing) and, as the illustration up top shows, can land almost anywhere. We see text in print, online, in skywriting and graffiti, in tattoos and crawling across the bottom of a cable news broadcast. Word-besotted humans have put it everywhere. The it is the media form, and the where is the media channel.

Media Form Spectrum

![](media-form-spectrum.png)

> In my taxonomy I break the idea of media form first into seven umbrella groups: Language, Image, Interaction, Object, Music, Odor and Flavor. That left to right order spreads them across a spectrum of most explicit (language) to most implicit (flavor) in how they communicate. Language is capable of being very explicit in how it communicates, if the circumstances are right. It is capable of great detail and narrative order or disorder. Words — written or spoken — can describe the absence of something where the other media forms cannot. As Sol Worth pointed out, “Pictures can’t say ain’t.” Language is never completely explicit, though. The reader or listener always brings her or his own experience to understanding a message.

> “Gown removed carelessly. Head, less so.” — Joss Whedon

> This is a little six-word story by the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It’s a nice example of how language is an implicit communicator too. When we read that sparse story we fill in all the blanks with our own experiences and remnants of other stories. We abhor the gaps and make up stuff to fill them ourselves. So yes, language is the most explicit of my seven categories, but that does not mean it is entirely explicit. Nothing achieves that when humans are involved in the communication.

![](media-form.png)

> From the umbrella category of Language, my taxonomy creates a structure to break that idea apart into ever-more-specific language forms. It can be written or spoken. Written language can be scribbled, sprayed, puffed into clouds, or set in a type font. Spoken language breaks into conversation, lecture, voice over and more. With each new level of specificity the media form of language finds more and more advantages, more ways of communication, and differentiates what it can or cannot say.

> Research Paper: Transmedia Journalism as a Post-Digital Narrative

---

> **Demand.** Today’s audiences expect their media to be social, participatory and customized for every device they use, especially the much-coveted hard-core fans who are especially drawn to properties which let them go them deeper into a story or discover something first. **Creativity.** The formulaic is giving way to the innovative, as producers, including a new crop of digital natives, compete to engage fans in their stories over time and space with new approaches and on new devices.

> “Why do we have to define it (transmedia storytelling) yet?”  asks indie filmmaker Lance Weiler. “Why can’t we just continue to experiment?”  Because, says TV writer-producer Jesse Alexander (Lost and Heroes) “You have to give it a name so people can talk about it. Isaac Newton didn’t discover gravity, he named it.”

**Chaotic Fiction**

> I define chaotic fiction as a fictional construct that begins with a set of rules, uses those rules to run its scenario through an organic "computer" comprised of audience and author, and ends with a finite body of work that was not predetermined. This is to say that, though the authors (those who set the rules and started the production of the fiction in motion) may have been able to predict with some measure of certainty what they might end up with upon completion of the product, since they did not have complete control during production of every element of creation, they could not say with absolute certainty beforehand exactly what would be created by the process.

> Why chaotic fiction? Well, the chaotic part describes the fact that the final product is not predetermined but rather unpredictable. And the fiction part is because what is being created isn't real, it's imagined. Chaotic fiction is produced in tandem between the authors or performers and the audience or players, and requires input from both sides. It begins with a set of ideas and ends wherever the performance or play may take it. The authors may set it in motion but they must work together with their audience to see its conclusion for the first time themselves. By its nature, it is improvisational in its production.

> Okay, I know that may not seem to make a lot of sense, which is again not unexpected. So let's continue with a description of the three key elements of chaotic fiction; they should present a clearer idea of what I am attempting to describe.

> I prefer to present these three key elements of chaotic fiction as three linear graphs. The first graph consists of the authors (or, as we know them in alternate reality gaming, the puppetmasters) on one end and the audience, or players, on the other. This defines who has more control over the development of the fiction, the people who produce it or those who engage with it.

![](https://github.com/HITECHCRIME/HC_OVERVIEW/blob/master/1_authorship.jpg)

> If we were to take a given campaign (ARG or not) such as the Daughters of Freya episodic email story and place it somewhere on the graph, most of us could agree it would find itself toward the author end of the spectrum, with the audience having little to no effect on the outcome. A game such as I Love Bees might be in the middle of the spectrum, as players were able to affect events within the game, but a majority of the plot and assets used were still premade. Finally, we could easily consider the Uncyclopedia as a chaotic fictional construct that would appear far to the audience end of the spectrum on this graph, being as it is largely anarchical in creation but still subject to certain rules imposed by the site creators.

> ARGs at the author end of the line would be most expository and give rise to very little player speculation about deeper meaning or motive, while games on the opposite end would offer clues as to the story but little in the way of explanation, leaving the story to be built almost wholly by the audience, as if a grand-scale Rorschach test. Where a given campaign might fall on the graph is more easily determined after it has completed, by simply looking at the fictional construct and determining the source of its bulk. Did the audience create more content or did the authors, to make up the whole? Regardless of the answer, it was necessary for them to do it together, in order to satisfy this element of the definition of chaotic fiction.

> I like graphs like this because they don't necessarily force you to define discrete boundaries. One game might be about there for you but more over here for me. Or one might say it falls somewhere within a range of values, rather than at a single point.

> The second key element is the ruleset. This describes how many restrictions are imposed upon the process of creation at the outset of or during the production. At one end sits total organization, a fixed and rigid framework, and at the other lies complete chaos, no holds barred, anything allowed.

![](2_ruleset.jpg)

> Now, I know you're going to say that there are no rules in ARGs, but those aren't the kind of rules I'm talking about here. What I refer to are the restrictions the authors impose upon the framework in which they present their campaign and the amount of the campaign itself that has been planned in advance. We might place a game with set rules and tangible goals like Last Call Poker at the more organized end of the graph, and we could consider the San-Francisco-based, almost entirely audience-run, game SF0 at the opposite end from LCP. How does the game play out, by what process is the fiction created? Organization or chaos?

> In some respects, this element is similar to the previous in that adjustments to it might allow more or less author or audience control over the development of the story. However, I think it is important to keep it as a separate metric.

> The third element is coherence. This refers to the amount of plot exhibited in the fictional construct. For instance, both SF0 and Uncyclopedia are largely plot-less, yet they may exhibit themes on a meta-scale, while what we consider traditional alternate reality games generally have quite distinct and in many cases linear, if mutable, plotlines. Yet both types of campaign can easily be said to exist somewhere on this spectrum. In some cases, the plot might be indeterminable during play, only interpreted in retrospect after the completion of the campaign. Again, this harks back to the previous metric, in that the amount or lack of plot may allow more or less audience or author control over the production of the fictional construct.

![](3_coherence.jpg)

> Now before you get all irate, I'm not really trying to categorize Uncyclopedia as an ARG. Remember, we are talking about chaotic fiction here. The above defines the context in which ARGs exist. I like to visualize the three graphs as three-dimensional axes. In each axis, it seems acceptable to say that the halfway point could describe an ARG, so that in it the audience and authors would have equal control over construction of the fiction, the construction was defined by a given ruleset but had equal latitude for change during play, and it had a decent, if not absolutely delineated, plot. Would that sound like an acceptable ARG? It should, because "definitely ARG" tends to sit right dead center of that three axis graph. How far out in each direction it extends may be up for debate, but we ought to be able to agree together on "around there somewhere." ARG then exists on that 3D graph as an amorphous cloud made up of the aggregate of everyone's individual – but hopefully informed – opinions about where things ought to be.

> And that's where it should begin to become clear why I said I couldn't define alternate reality gaming, because the definition is both mutable in time and dependent upon the current, collective opinions of all of its participants.

![](4_sphere_of_chaotic_fiction.jpg)

> Now, astute observers may note that the above covers the last two of my observations, yet I still have not explicitly addressed the first. In a way, though, I have by focusing the above descriptions on character of the fictional constructs created rather than on the process of their creation. I call that process of creation, the running of the organic story-generator, Chaotic Play. Chaotic play is the process and it is the experience of the creation of chaotic fiction. It can also be used to describe the process or experience of creating Chaotic Theatre, which I define as exactly like chaotic fiction except ephemeral, in that it does not exist in tangible form beyond the experience of creation, except in the memories of the participants.

> Why chaotic play? Well the chaotic bit is for the same reason given previously, natch. As for play, I can think of no better way to describe the process of starting some fictional creation in motion and letting the audience influence its outcome. In a sense, it may be massively collaborative authorship or writing, but the element of the unknown outcome lends more to the analogy of gaming. A premise is formed, a system of rules is set in motion, and the gaming of the system by the authors and audience creates not only the tangible chaotic fiction as a result, but in the process is itself an undefinable and wholly unique experience.

> Alternate reality games are chaotic play when they run, and produce chaotic fiction as a result. They are a subset of the whole of possibilities of chaotic fiction and play, but to me they are a strong subset. On the other hand, chaotic play may not necessarily be an ARG even if it exhibits similar characteristics to other ARGs, and even though it produces chaotic fiction or theatre.

> This is where you ask why I didn't use a lot of descriptions of how characters should interact by IM or email or how realistic their websites should look or whatever your pet detail is that should be present in every "true ARG." The answer is simple: just as with other types of fiction that are wholly created before they are ever presented to the audience, such as books, movies, poetry, music albums, etc., the medium or media with which chaotic fiction and thus ARGs are delivered, the types of canvases upon which their histories are painted, none of these things have any ultimate impact upon the fiction itself. They are instead elements of chaotic play.

> I have other examples of this new, internet-enabled, massively collaborative process of creation that are similar to chaotic fiction. I would describe the generation of Wikipedia as Chaotic Fact. Open Source Software can easily be seen as Chaotic Programming, in that its users are able to add features or fixes to the software they utilize, and provide those changes back to the central code repository to be incorporated in the "official version." I would even categorize what Markos Moulitsas terms as "people-powered politics" to be Chaotic Governance, after a fashion. And Chaotic Nature is embodied by Darwin's theory of evolution, although in that case we cannot be certain whether or not the changes induced in the system are purposeful. But these are discussions for the future.

> In addition to the above elements of all chaotic fiction, I believe that there are other defining characteristics of the subset that is known as alternate reality gaming. These would include things like the encouragement of audience community-forming and collaboration by the framework of the production. The use of puzzles, hidden but discoverable elements of plot, and other required leaps of logic and intuition would be another. However important these techniques are to ARG in its current incarnation, they may not ultimately prove to be required components.

> I must now apologize to all of those to whom I have categorically denied that an ARG could be a single-player experience. While technically true in that I would anticipate the need for at least one operator and one processor in gaming an ARG, it is also true that a single audience member could indeed play alone, which is the commonly accepted definition of "single-player," as previous references have generally not considered a collaboration during production between author and audience. Sorry about that.

> Note that the visual aids used in this article were drawn for simplicity and illustration only and do not necessarily reflect my personal measurement of those products along the metrics provided. It should also be noted that the above descriptions ought to make clear why there is a huge difference between the terms "game" and "gaming."

# Hitech Crime Universe Notes
A couple of notes relating to the design of the story, the vibe and the brand that Hitech Crime is intended to be.

To use the word 'transmedia' for describing your activity in PR and creation you need:
- more than 1 media to use
- more than 1 story to tell
- more than 1 technology that you (or even likely your team) can use
- time to create a big world with maximum details first

And you need to remember about some different specialities in your audience such as:
- they are fragmented (and it means you can never know what was the story that gave 1st step to your consumers)
- tend to some kind of addiction to things they love
- then to unite through activity around points of attraction (and your world - that you created before - must generate these points aplenty)
- they like to fill in the gaps - and you must leave some spaces to be filled by your audience.

**How to apply the notes to Hitech Crime**
- Main motivational arc - "take future into your own hands"
- audiovisual transmedia experience (digital, IRL, live, audio, visual, interactive)
- characters, Protagonists, Deuteragonists, Confidants

       protagonist hacker, underdog, reality hacker (vishacker)
       
       sidekick: girl vishacker
       
       sidekick: mechanoreceptor - tough anarchist
       
       nemesis: human evil, ignorance, stagnation, harsh world into protopia
       
> Flesh out character traits by creating a character diamond. Understand the character’s primary trait (their north star), secondary trait (their counter star), their non-negotiable (the thing they are prepared to die on a hill for) and their weakness or fatal flaw.
         
# Narrative Arcs for Hitech Crime
- main pieces of albums (meaning turn these below into EP as well)
- the main song like for example "Monument to the future" would be a longplay 10min (with narration) but there would be a "radio edit" included in the album (bonus content) and multiple points of access with variation
- make them go along with EP releases
- or make them into another album plot steps
- Hitech Crime's purpose is to embed the idea of generation of ideas by continuous exposition to different timelines and types of platforms of media.
- "Join the narrative!" main call to action > newsletter + links to all relevant social platforms (storyworld content types) 
- lovecraft mythos, folklore/legends, agents of shield/marvel, cyberpunk

# Content Cloud

> Interface is king; nothing kills an ambitious multiplatform effort faster than a clunky point of entry." -Jessica Clark

## Hitech Crime Technical Storytelling Paradigms

- **content must be unique**

Rather than repeating the information on different platforms, use different parts of a story to match a platform’s strength and maximize user experience. 

- **seamless point of entry**

Because audience engagement is central to this form of storytelling, make sure whichever platform you’re using gets readers to interact in a very simple way.

- **make partner connections**

Can't do it alone if the projectspan is large.

- **keep it cost-effective**

> “You can incorporate transmedia in a low-cost way, like introducing social media as a way to extend the story. It depends on your goals and what you’re trying to achieve.”

- **the story is the most important**

- **let the traditional media work in conjunction with digital media for full spectrum**

## RELEASE can consist of:
- album release (audiovisual/physical/digital)
- short story series
- behind the scenes/making of (Helve Logs via Helve AVR Creative Ops)
- short web series narrative
- longform 'stick it together' version of the web series
- audio podcast version
- interactive IRL storytelling  exhibition (chapter)
- livestream narrative
- live event IRL (concert, semi-LARP)
- livestreams IRL Helve Logs
- FB dopamine hook
- Insta 9grid dopamine hook
- virtual scenes (photogrammetric snapshot)
- game/VR render/experience
- real world guerilla reality hacking (also livestreamed)
- real world guerilla effect, experience the exposition -> universe content, photos,  videos, character shots
- Agent Experience Logs_ outlet for fans who take part in the universe 
- art installation
- Alexa Narrative Experience (voice narrative, old radio shows)
- TikTok -> clues for puzzles for the audience (cryptic account)
- mystery teaser 01 (twitter) part 1/2 -> go through socials to piece the message together
- mystery teaser 02 (fb) part 2/2 -> go through socials to piece the message together
- Include websites like LOST did, but to have things that happen on the real internet affect what happens in the narrative universe - posts and events pop up in the narrative. A fictional project that interacts with the real audience in the story. One way medium no more. Things audience does online affects the storylines.

Quick notes on the dream I had about a geolocated app as an entry point.

- another platform to distribute narrative/audiovisual content would be to create your own app that would be updated as the new releases, new narrative elements, timelines, concepts, puzzles appear
- distribution of content via geolocating app (version of Helve Global Operations Map but for the "in-universe" presence of audience - players?)
- app would be the curated version of the released content (segregated into timelines, creating a plot point structure so to speak) - easy for people to "travel" across timelines and discover narrative arcs.
- app would have virtual goodies available to pick up 
- app geolocating system would have actual physical things related to the Hitech Crime universe hidden in the real world and available to pick up for those who manage to triangulate their position through clues (merch, goodies)
- app would have subscription for premium content?
- app would have live show tickets included in the subscription? or separate purchase via website (Apple doesn't allow buying from within apps)
- app would be basically a mobile version of the hitechcri.me website (website would be the go to for all main content)
- wiki of hitech crime universe > hitechcri.me/timeline (there are MAIN NODES/ALBUM RELEASES - unlock node by sharing with humans, TIMELINES - arcs of releases, CONTENT CLOUD - associated types of content related to the release - see more examples below.

Other types to consider:

Niantic Version of engagement with the user (Real Life As A Platform?).

# Ideas for releases

> UNRAVEL SMALL BEGINNINGS: Create your origin story in this order: how it all started, what happened next, when it all took off, what have you learned along the way. These kinds of stories tend to do very well. Why? Because people love these rags-to-riches kinds of stories. We love hearing stories about how something from the bottom made its way to the top. It draws more inspiration in hopes that one day, we might do the same. A great story can help plant a product in people’s minds without them even realizing it – all you need to do is learn how to listen, communicate, and connect.

- scene where i'm seen displaying the qr code briefly on a handheld display or piece of paper and some other dude scanning it with their phone (recorded as if undercover surveillance)
- camera starts following me through an alley and some corridors. at one point i turn around and show a painted square with QR code on it (Children of Men vibe) then title
- QR code is a website leading to a short story related to the song + title and artist of the song
- QR code also could be the download link for the release.
- Sara Mora - drone roof in łódź scene (ask her for more details)
- golden glowing neons (squares) in the background of a room - Deus Ex Human Revolution vibe
- scene: short clips for general purpose: zooming in towards me meditating with my back towards the camera.
- walking through a dark alley, techwear looks, golden glasses, hoodie, i take out my phone and AR elements pop up lighting the surroundings
- lying on the floor in darkness with glowing white cables attached to my halfnaked flesh (motif from Dryspace song storyboard)
- alternative contrasting scene, glowing environment full of light with black sillouettes of cables and my body
- crouching scene, shadow on my face, one can only see the golden reflection of the sunglasses
- Plot Magic: symbolic themes of Hitech Crime. Example: flickering lights or just presence of NEON LIGHTS whenever something important is being passed on or important things are happening both for the narrative and the audience. CGI-rendered (Ian Hubert - Blender) moths follow everywhere in the background of the scenes (reflective state of mind, going towards personal light)
- IDEA: Current times scene but giant hovering ships in the air. Constructs hovering over ground.
- idea: every day items mirrored. Jacket with words backwards. Signal: these items have been interacted and moved by a 4-dimensional being. Idea for reccuring album theme.
- idea: CGI-blended environments/enhanced reality. Standing on a bridge hanging above a hitech furnace. fire particles floating in the air. wearing a longcoat and a thief's beanie. looking at a person on the other side opposite side of the brigde
- head of the architect is seen veiled in mystery, at the very beginning of the series, being jarred and isolated as a power source. the architect is the idea generation machine.
- Distort the timeline, fragment the narrative.
- Register various domains for fictional places and concepts.
- Use texting platform as the most intimate platform of breaching the 4th wall.

![](qrs-within-narratives.png)

Community Engagement Idea: "You know what kind of night it is when Hitech Crime red glows on the streets" - audience uses synchronized set up of red lamps. Symbolic meaning would be that we invite the narrative into our private space and interact with it.

- unpredictable and unusual approaches to storytelling (what the audience prefers the most)
- Narrative Preview Release for press/blog features cinematic sneak peek.

# Tech that goes along with the conceptual

Full frame 35mm cinema Sigma FP + VOIGTLANDER 35MM F1.4 SC "This lens has a lot of character. Something about it makes snapshot look like **memories**. Though it's not a "clean lens"." Vintage lens used for hitech themes. The image of a memory is an important aspect of this specific setup (bokeh+grain type). There is a unique distortion of the background as well.

# Transfer these into album plot progression cloud

There are people around me standing by the pillars. As the tele lens shot moves a couple of masked individuals start coming  slowly towards me. Then we see teams setting up neons in various places around the globe. Back of the head shot frame: "It's time." "Monument to the Future" text appears. Neons light up in many other abandoned places. "HITECH CRIME presents" "MOTHNODE" logos flash.

Based on a couple of years of memetic research during the university years. Went deep into the topic with my best friend at the time. We created lore and mental structures for a feature film script that was supposed to go deep into the memeplexes. It was about a humanoid manifestation of language/memeplexes being a hybrid between human and memetic agent. Abstract film.

> In real life, language is a 'meme' and reacting to an insult in a negative way is a 'memetic effect'. An anomalous memetic effect is when a meme has an effect that doesn't occur in the real world.

# Audiovisual IRL Experiences (Audio Universe Experience - livestream/live)
Ideas for the visuals and setups for concerts. Could also be applied to live online concerts.
- wall of death with a vertical "laser gate" pulsing and expanding to separate two groups of people. It lifts in the middle before the clash as the drop comes.
- aggro popup concert from a mobile backpack audio unit
- VR Concerts
- Livestream Concerts (UNKNOWN LOCATION)
- secret location concerts
- "now we will cleanse the perimeter with bass to get rid of the (audible) bad programs" / "audio weapon" - purging tool
- laser-gating
- laser ceiling scissors (lasers shifting horizontally above user's head)
- concerts are literally audiovisual sets - theatrical almost, with placing importance on pacing, pressurizing and depressurizing the audience, tension vs relax vs intrigue.
- Look at the BTSM experiences they create (they include narrative experiences, lasers, smoke and colorful glitchy. Church of BTSM). It is more rave like tho.
- Dropbox contains a lot of visal inspirations. Comb through it!
- Crypto-rave Excerpt:
```
‘You’ve been invited to join our next crypto-rave.’ You click on the link sent by the crypto-rave network and get sent to the website of the next event. In the centre of the page there is a button that says ‘mine’, you press it and sit back. After a couple of hours you get a message that you’ve unlocked your new raver identity. Your new name is Eva Black and your character even has a personality. After six more hours of making your computer available to a crypto mining pool, you unlock your ticket and receive the secret location for the rave. 

You take the bus to an outskirt and find yourself in-between buildings that look like they’ve been left by their owners a long time ago. You walk through an alley and see a big red circle, illuminating the darkness. As you get closer you see people queuing in front of a door. This must be it. Mesmerized you get closer and see people wearing masks, there’s a guy in front of you who turns around and stares at you with one cat eye lens. Behind you, a girl that looks like she just stepped out of the Matrix, lights her cigarette. You wonder if they all have a new identity just like you. 

At the door the bouncer asks your name. You mention Eva Black is here, he nods you in. Inside you see even more people that have dressed up in most unique ways. You walk the hallway and pass some rooms filled with colors and lights. You stop at one room that catches your attention. People are dancing. Not the ordinary style, but they’re learning Butoh: a Japanese theatre dance, where the dancers perform the dance of the death and disease, to gain insight. You move on to the next room where people are meditating. To end up in a room blasting techno. 

Welcome, to the crypto-rave.

> Observation that the very act of becoming a player changes the game being played. It is reflected in interviewing process where the interviewees tend to give answers they think interviewer wants to hear. Named after German Noble-laureate physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901-76) whose uncertainty principle states that (in particle physics experiments) the very act of observing alters the position of the particle being observed, and makes it impossible (even in theory) to accurately predict its behavior. See also observer inseparability.

El ídolo tuyo es una marioneta
Dale en la nuca 
Subelo a la guagua

Ya me tomé la tableta de xanax
Pintando con tu sangre el pentagrama
Se abre tu pecho y te salen garras
Y así me robó de tu alma
Miedo mi 
Tu cara de horror 
Cuando me vistes empacado en el congelador

No quedarán tus huesos después de la cena
Dale un latigazo pa que pague por sus penas
Ya tengo tu medula congelada en la nevera

Based on a couple of years of memetic research during the university years. Went deep into the topic with my best friend at the time. We created lore and mental structures for a feature film script that was supposed to go deep into the memeplexes. It was about a humanoid manifestation of language/memeplexes being a hybrid between human and memetic agent. Abstract film.

> In real life, language is a 'meme' and reacting to an insult in a negative way is a 'memetic effect'. An anomalous memetic effect is when a meme has an effect that doesn't occur in the real world.

- EP where each song is basically an episode of a web series (this could slowly turn into a trap musical narrative haha)
- MOTHNODE_ SLC6A3 (Gene codename - dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome - good for productivity esoterism albums)

https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC6A3

> The SLC6A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the dopamine transporter or DAT. This protein is embedded in the membrane of certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it transports a molecule called dopamine into the cell. Dopamine is a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that relays signals from one neuron to another. Dopamine has many important functions, including playing complex roles in thought (cognition), motivation, behavior, and control of movement.

> To transmit signals, dopamine is released into the space between neurons (the synaptic cleft), where it attaches (binds) to receptors on the surface of neighboring neurons. The dopamine transporter brings dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into neurons for reuse. The activity of the transporter determines how much dopamine is present in the synaptic cleft and for how long. This activity makes the transporter a major controller of dopamine signaling in the brain.

# Content Types & Promo Methods

- Distributors (The Orchard, Distrokid)
- Spotify for Artists (submit songs for editors)
- promo video banner with "Debut Album "X" Preorder Now ---- at hitechcri.me"
- pre-save link in profiles!
- announce on social media (9tile posts, stories, narrative storyworld elements deployment, personal video etc)
- establish a target goal for a release
- set a timeline for this goal (2 months total - 1 month - before release build awareness, presaves, blog features etc - 1 month - after release engage with the followers, use the audience content related to your release, make them part of it, build stream target)
- blog features (SubmitHub) Narrative Preview Release for press/blog features cinematic sneak peek.
- radioplay:

1. under 4 minutes, has no derogatory terms, no political or religious message
2. if you have a whole EP/album pick one track to be the flagship song, usually it is the one that sounds the most commercial. get a lot of opinions to narrow down the selection.
3. make a soundcloud private track link (if it's before release). never attach mp3 to the e-mail.
4. make a download link (Dropbox) - full quality
5. pitch process - make it personal, introduce yourself, explain what you are doing, what you did in the past and what you want from them. needs to be short and precise but has to convince, so underline the things that make you stand out as an artist (give legitimacy). find similar sounding songs played by the station to break the ice and proves familiarity with what the station offers for their audience. this way they know what to expect.
6. choose stations - look where artists in a similar genre are being published. you can also start smaller, regional radio (hmm might be problematic due to Polish language being the priority for local stations).
7. BBC Introducing? If it gets chosen, follow up and thank them. offer and interview or a session.
8. Amazing Radio is very supportive (via amazingtunes website)
9. genre-specific radio stations

# Audio Description Template (Song Upload) EDIT IT PROPERLY

- modify the audio and audiovisual content descriptions to direct to themselves (perhaps make it a bit more like 'watch the cinematic narrative video on YouTube, instead of just subscribe on YouTube: x link x'

- add lore snippet to hook /// DISCOVER HITECH CRIME UNIVERSE or something like that. Quote from the world? Some explanation or setting description?

- use Linkfire to direct to the latest release (see if there is a gentler way of doing this)

that sys tech too many nulls aye 
i ain't givin' up - hackin' real till we cut
i'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
we bring home-ooor-we-dry in space till we done aye

gettin' it done, tough nails 
through the coffin 
life runs its own course 
along the lines of others 
telling you to stop so often 

let'em try to touch you 
with their orders 
words of dire that mean nothing 
they mean nothing to you lot
they mean nothing

they meant something
now they mean nothing
they meant something
now they mean nothing
whispers whispers whispers whispers 
whispers to run no
friction to run
no friction to run aye

ya aye
prrrrrrrrrrr

that sys tech took many nulls aye 
i ain't givin' up - hackin' real till we cut
i'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
we bring home or we dry in space till we done aye

gettin' it done, tough nails 
through the coffin 
life runs its own course 
along the lines of others 
telling you to stop so often 
let'em try to touch you 
with their orders 
words of dire that mean nothing 
they mean nothing to you lot
they mean nothing

they mean nothing 
they mean nothing

# Audio Mixing Methodology

## Personal Singing Cadances

- high humming
- melodic singing
- whisper
- high scream
- low growl
- fast spit
- lead bars

## Tips for recording

Basic raw vocal solo recording compressor settings:
2.9:1 ratio, -30 threshold, in 0, out 0, attack 0-x, release max

Low buffer size when recording.

High buffer size when mixing.

Use buses -50% in CPU usage.

Create a stereo slapback delay.

Use 2 room reverbs.

Serial compression for control and tone.

Learn to volume balance.

Organization system is essential.

Certain keys reflect specific types of emotions (example D Minor reflect a specific kind of sadness).

Concept of octave stacking.

4stack octave - example -64, -30 +30, +64

Remember to take breaks for the ears - after a prolonged session ears themselves start distorting sounds as one gets accustomed to the sound of the song.

Mix in mono 80% of the song, 20% stereo (ambience).

## Mixing Pathway

**Version 01**

1. Mix Prep:
- template 

(beat bus, vocal bus x 2 - depending how many tracks there are)

Common types of tracks: beat, verse, upverse, intro, main hook, uphook, adlibs - usually 6 tracks unless more natural harmonies are required (like 4stack octave harmonies).

- levels
- sends

2. Mix Bus Processing:
- mid/side EQ
- Creme
- Saturation

3. Cleaning:
- noise
- breaths (don't cut them out, reduce input gain on each breath, more natural)
- auto-tune
- eq

4. Compressor Combo:
- CLA76 (combo of two versions on top of vocal, punch and subtle)

> bluey, in -47, out -12, att 4, rel 7 4:1 ratio

> blackey, in max, out -30, att 1, rel 7, all ratio

+ combo with CLA2A (peak reduction 45, gain 35)

Alternative: RCompressor + RVox

**Version 02**

1. Balance.
2. Fix.
3. Enhance/make larger.
4. Shape space.
5. Space+depth+panning.

-6db headroom
-9db beat
-11 vox (lower than beat, compressor will accomodate)
